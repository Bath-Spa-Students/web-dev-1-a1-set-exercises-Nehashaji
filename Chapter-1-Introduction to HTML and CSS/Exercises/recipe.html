<!--Paragraph describing the recipe-->
<p><i><strong>Gulab jamun </strong></i>is among India's most popular desserts
and is often referred to as "Indian doughnuts." 
This delicious sweet treat consists of soft, melt-in-your-mouth, 
fried dumplings that are traditionally made of thickened or reduced milk 
and then soaked in a sugar syrup made with rose water (which you can buy or make).
This recipe uses powdered milk and heavy cream, but the results are just as delicious.</p>
<br>
<p>The name comes from two words. Gulab means "rose" and refers to the rose syrup. 
Jamun is a kind of deep purple-colored Indian berry, which the dark brown dumplings resemble 
after they're cooked. The rose-flavored syrup lends the dessert a beautiful fragrance and makes 
it feel decadent and very special. Gulab jamun can be served warm or at room temperature
and with a variety of extras to make the dessert even more exceptional, such as chopped pistachios. 
Best of all, it's relatively easy to make.</p><br>

<h2><u>METHODS</u></h2>
<!--Ordered list for listing the methods -->
<ol>
    <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
    <li>Add the water and sugar to a large saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally until the sugar dissolves.</li>
    <li>Turn off the heat and stir in the ground cardamom and rose water. Set the syrup aside.</li>
    <li>In a large bowl, combine the powdered milk, flour, and baking powder.</li>
    <li>Add the heavy cream a little at a time while kneading to make a dough that is medium-soft but not sticky. You may not use all the cream.Use just enough to reach the desired consistency; the smoother it is,
         the better, and the less likely that the dough will become hard when
        it's fried.</li>
    <li>Lightly oil the palms of your hands.</li>
    <li>Once the dough is ready, divide it into walnut-sized balls, rolling it between your palms until nice and smooth.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, fill a wide pan with enough oil to deep fry the doughnuts. Heat the oil medium heat to between 350 F and 360 F.</li>
    <li>Carefully add the gulab jamun and fry, in batches if necessary to not crowd the pan, turning often to brown all sides.</li>
    <li>Once cooked, remove the doughnuts with a slotted spoon, allowing the oil to drain.</li>
    <li>Transfer immediately into the rose syrup.</li>
    <li>Repeat this until all the dumplings are cooked and in the syrup. Allow the gulab jamun to soak in the syrup for at least 2 hours before serving. </li>
 </ol>

<!--Heading for notes-->
<h2><u>NOTES</u></h2>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, make sure to use good quality milk powder, as it plays a vital role.</li>
<li>Also, do not replace the baking powder with baking soda. if using soda then <br>
    there are chances to break while frying.</li>
<li>Additionally, fry on low flame else Jamun will remain raw from the inside.</li>
<li>Finally, the gulab jamun recipe tastes great when the jamuns are well-soaked and super soft.</li>
